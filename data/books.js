            "Tyrus grew up in a world without seasons, only snow and ice. A world, where humans and elves used to get along. A world, where fiery magic once thrived through a connection between owls and people. A world, he is destined to save.",
            "Long ago, a never-ending winter conquered all of the Wingspan Continent, and any hopes of that ever changing, had died silent deaths. But when Tyrus bonds with a curious owl that shouldn't exist, all those hopes are resurrected. He becomes the first Owlbound mage in over a century, capable of wielding the magical flames of legend and myth.",
            "Together with the friends he makes along the way, he embarks on a fantastical journey to bring back the dancing seasons of ages lost and free his world from winter's deadly beak. ",
